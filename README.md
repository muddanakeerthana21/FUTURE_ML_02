# FUTURE_ML_02
## 🚨 Customer Churn Prediction System (Future Interns – ML Task 2)

### 📌 Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Future Interns Machine Learning Internship – Task 2**.
The goal is to build a **Customer Churn Prediction System** that identifies customers likely to churn (stop using the service) and provides business-friendly insights through a dashboard.

Customer churn prediction is highly valuable in industries like **telecom, SaaS, banking**, and subscription-based businesses because retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Explore and clean customer churn dataset
* Perform feature engineering and preprocessing
* Train multiple classification models
* Evaluate performance using classification metrics
* Predict churn probability for each customer
* Segment customers by churn risk
* Visualize churn drivers using Power BI dashboard

---

### ✅ Key Features

* ✅ Data cleaning & preprocessing (missing values, encoding categorical data)
* ✅ Trained multiple ML models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* ✅ Model evaluation using:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  * Confusion Matrix
  * ROC-AUC score and ROC Curve
* ✅ Churn probability prediction per customer
* ✅ Risk segmentation:

  * Low Risk
  * Medium Risk
  * High Risk
  * Very High Risk
* ✅ Feature Importance chart (top churn drivers)
* ✅ Interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers + insights

### 🛠️ Tech Stack / Tools Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **XGBoost**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Power BI Desktop**

### 🚀 How to Run the Project

#### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib
```

#### 2️⃣ Run notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run:

* `FutureInterns_Task2_ChurnPrediction.ipynb`

This generates:

* `churn_predictions.csv`
* `feature_importance.csv`

#### 3️⃣ Open Power BI dashboard

Open Power BI Desktop and load:

* Telco churn dataset
* churn_predictions.csv
* feature_importance.csv

Then open the `.pbix` file.

---

### 📌 Business Insights (Sample)

* Month-to-month contracts show highest churn risk
* Customers using electronic check show higher churn probability
* High churn probability customers require retention focus
